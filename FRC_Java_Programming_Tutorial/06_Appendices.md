## 2. Troubleshooting Tips

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue                              | Possible Cause                          | Solution                                   |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Robot code fails to deploy         | Network connection issue                | Ensure your computer is connected to the robot's network. |
| Motors not responding              | Incorrect motor IDs or wiring           | Verify motor IDs and check wiring.        |
| Autonomous mode not working        | Incorrect trajectory or logic           | Debug the trajectory and logic in your code. |
| Camera feed not displaying         | Camera not initialized or connected     | Check camera initialization and wiring.   |

### Debugging Techniques
1. **Use the Driver Station Logs**: The FRC Driver Station provides logs that can help identify issues.
2. **Print Statements**: Use `System.out.println()` to debug your code.
3. **Simulation Mode**: Test your code in simulation before deploying it to the robot.

## 3. Best Practices

- **Organize Your Code**: Use the command-based structure to keep your code modular and maintainable.
- **Test Frequently**: Test your code often to catch issues early.
- **Document Your Code**: Add comments to explain your logic and make it easier for others to understand.
