# 🤖 **Introduction to FRC Programming**

In this section, we will introduce you to **FRC programming concepts**, including WPILib, setting up your development environment, and understanding the basic structure of an FRC robot program.

## 📘 **1. Overview of WPILib**

WPILib is the software library used in FRC to control robots. It provides tools and APIs for:
- **Motor control**
- **Sensor integration**
- **Autonomous and teleoperated modes**
- **Networking and communication with the Driver Station**

### 🔑 **Key Components of WPILib**:
- **Subsystems**: Represent physical components of the robot (e.g., drivetrain, arm).
- **Commands**: Define actions for the robot to perform.
- **Scheduler**: Manages the execution of commands.

## 🛠️ **2. Setting Up the Development Environment**

To start programming your FRC robot, follow these steps:

1. **Install Required Software**:
   - [📥 VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - [📥 WPILib Installer](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html)

2. **Create a New Robot Project**:
   - Open **VS Code**.
   - Use the **WPILib extension** to create a new project.
   - Select the appropriate template (e.g., Command-Based Robot).

3. **Deploy Code to the Robot**:
   - Connect your computer to the robot's network.
   - Use the **"Deploy Robot Code"** option in VS Code.

## 🧩 **3. Basic Robot Code Structure**

An FRC robot program typically consists of the following files:

### 🔹 **Robot.java**
This is the main entry point of your robot program. It defines the robot's lifecycle methods:
- `robotInit()`: Runs once when the robot starts.
- `autonomousInit()`: Runs once at the start of autonomous mode.
- `teleopInit()`: Runs once at the start of teleoperated mode.
- `robotPeriodic()`: Runs periodically in all modes.

### 🛠️ **Example: Basic Robot.java**
```java
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.TimedRobot;

public class Robot extends TimedRobot {
    @Override
    public void robotInit() {
        System.out.println("Robot Initialized");
    }

    @Override
    public void autonomousInit() {
        System.out.println("Autonomous Mode Started");
    }

    @Override
    public void teleopInit() {
        System.out.println("Teleop Mode Started");
    }

    @Override
    public void robotPeriodic() {
        System.out.println("Robot Periodic Task");
    }
}
```

### 🔹 **Subsystems**
Subsystems represent physical components of the robot, such as the drivetrain or arm.

### 🛠️ **Example: Drivetrain Subsystem**
```java
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj2.command.SubsystemBase;

public class Drivetrain extends SubsystemBase {
    public void drive(double speed, double rotation) {
        System.out.println("Driving with speed: " + speed + " and rotation: " + rotation);
    }
}
```

---

### 🔹 **Commands**
Commands define actions for the robot to perform, such as moving forward or turning.

### 🛠️ **Example: Drive Command**
```java
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj2.command.CommandBase;

public class DriveCommand extends CommandBase {
    private final Drivetrain drivetrain;

    public DriveCommand(Drivetrain drivetrain) {
        this.drivetrain = drivetrain;
        addRequirements(drivetrain);
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        drivetrain.drive(0.5, 0.0); // Drive forward at half speed
    }
}
```
